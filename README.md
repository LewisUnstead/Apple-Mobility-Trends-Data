# Updated Mobility Trends Reports

This repository will be updated daily with the new mobility trends data provided by Apple (https://www.apple.com/covid19/mobility).

I will be obtaining this data using my Scraping-with-Selenium repository and will be implemented in my Apple-Mobility-Data repository to provide up-to-date data for my analysis there.
